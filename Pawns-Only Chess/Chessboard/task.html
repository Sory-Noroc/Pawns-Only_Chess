<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Chess has many variations. One of them is Pawns-only chess. It has only pawns. Not even a king. In this project, you create a two-player program for this chess variant.</p>

<p>In this stage, you need to print a chessboard made of characters as seen in the following picture:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="261" src="https://ucarecdn.com/a5f6dcd0-7e26-4403-9ba8-dd4de2357929/" width="246"></p>

<p>The white pawns are denoted with the capital <code class="java">W</code>, the black pawns are the capital <code class="java">B</code> characters.</p>

<p>A unique pair of coordinates (a letter and a number) identifies each square of the chessboard. From White's left to right, the squares in the vertical lines are called <strong>files</strong>. They are labeled from <code class="java">a</code> to <code class="java">h</code>. The horizontal lines, known as <strong>ranks</strong>, are numbered from <code class="java">1</code> to <code class="java">8</code>. These are legit coordinate pairs: <code class="java">a2</code>, <code class="java">c6</code>, <code class="java">d8</code>, <code class="java">h5</code>, and so on. This corresponds to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">chess algebraic notation</a> for recording moves in chess.</p>

<p>The Pawns-only chess has very simple rules. The pawns can make any <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">standard pawn moves</a>, except promotion. A player wins the game when one of the pawns reaches the opponent's last row, or if all opponent pawns are captured. A draw occurs when one of the players is unable to make a valid move. This is called a stalemate.</p>

<p>Use a <strong>monospaced font</strong> for the program output, to print the chessboard correctly. It is a font with fixed-width characters. By default, IntelliJ IDEA uses the monospaced font.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>Print the program name: <code class="java">Pawns-Only Chess</code> and the text chessboard (see Example 1). Note the number of spaces.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

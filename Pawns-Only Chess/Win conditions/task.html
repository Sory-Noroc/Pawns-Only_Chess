<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Our game is almost complete. One more thing remains — we need to establish the win/draw conditions.</p>

<p>The game is over when either player succeeds in moving their pawn to the last opposite rank — <strong>rank 8</strong> for White, <strong>rank 1 </strong>for Black. The game is also over when all opposite pawns are captured.</p>

<p>Stalemate (draw) occurs when a player can't make any valid move on their turn.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>The program should check whether the winning or stalemate conditions are met <strong>after each turn</strong>.</p>

<p>If the <strong>winning</strong> conditions are fulfilled, print <code class="java">White Wins!</code> or <code class="java">Black Wins!</code>, depending on the situation. Then, print <code class="java">Bye!</code> and exit the program.</p>

<p>If it's a <strong>stalemate</strong>, print <code class="java">Stalemate!</code><span style="color: #222222;">, </span><code class="java">Bye!</code> and exit the program.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>White wins by moving a pawn across the whole board</em></p>

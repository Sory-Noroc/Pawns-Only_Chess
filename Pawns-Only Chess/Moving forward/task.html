<h5>Description</h5>

<p>There are several moves that a pawn can make â€” a <strong>forward move</strong> and a <strong>capture</strong>. In this stage, you need to implement forwards moves only. A forward move is a move that propels your pawn by <strong>one</strong> <strong>rank </strong>(horizontal line) if the square is not taken by another pawn, or by <strong>two ranks </strong>if this is the first move of the pawn:</p>

    </figure>
</div>

<p>If a user inputs an invalid or impossible move, warn them with a message and ask for another move.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>When a player inputs a valid move, the program should move the pawn and print an updated chessboard (see Example 1).</p>

<p>If a user inputs a move and there is no pawn at the initial square, or it is a pawn of the opposite color, print <code class="java">No white pawn at &lt;Start position&gt;</code> or <code class="java">No black pawn at &lt;Start position&gt;</code>, where <code class="java">&lt;Start position&gt;</code> is the initial square and ask for another move.</p>

<p>Print <code class="java">Invalid Input</code> and ask to make another move if the player's move is invalid.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>Correct moves</em></p>

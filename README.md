# Pawns-Only Chess
A game similar to chess but only played with pawns, based on CLI.
When a player makes a move, the program outputs the board with the moved pawn, or an error message in case of an invalid move(foreign pawn, moves out of the table, etc)

The game starts at [main](https://github.com/Sory-Noroc/Pawns-Only_Chess/blob/master/Pawns-Only%20Chess/task/src/chess/Main.kt), with asking player names, then prompting for alternating moves from each.

# Pawns-Only Chess
Project suggested in the JetBrains Academy course, a game similar to chess but only played with pawns, based on CLI.
When a player makes a move, the program outputs the board with the moved pawn, or an error message in case of an invalid move(foreign pawn, moves out of the table, etc)
